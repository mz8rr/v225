title: Diffusion Models To Predict 3D Late Mechanical Activation From Sparse 2D Cardiac MRIs 
abstract: Identifying regions of late mechanical activation (LMA) of the left ventricular
  (LV) myocardium is critical in determining the optimal pacing site for cardiac resynchronization
  therapy in patients with heart failure. Several deep learning-based approaches have
  been developed to predict 3D LMA maps of LV myocardium from a stack of sparse 2D
  cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs). However, these models often loosely consider
  the geometric shape structure of the myocardium. This makes the reconstructed activation
  maps suboptimal; hence leading to a reduced accuracy of predicting the late activating
  regions of hearts. In this paper, we propose to use shape-constrained diffusion
  models to better reconstruct a 3D LMA map, given a limited number of 2D cardiac
  MRI slices. In contrast to previous methods that primarily rely on spatial correlations
  of image intensities for 3D reconstruction, our model leverages object shape as
  priors learned from the training data to guide the reconstruction process. To achieve
  this, we develop a joint learning network that simultaneously learns a mean shape
  under deformation models. Each reconstructed image is then considered as a deformed
  variant of the mean shape. To validate the performance of our model, we train and
  test the proposed framework on a publicly available mesh dataset of 3D myocardium
  and compare it with state-of-the-art deep learning-based reconstruction models.
  Experimental results show that our model achieves superior performance in reconstructing
  the 3D LMA maps as compared to the state-of-the-art models.
